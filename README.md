### Projects

Throughout the course, I have completed multiple projects, both with guidance from video lectures and independently. This repository includes all the projects I have worked on, and while there are numerous projects in this collection, I'll highlight a few remarkable ones below that have provided me with the most valuable learning experiences.

#### Dice Roller

This straightforward application enables the user to roll a 6-sided die by clicking on a button. Despite its simplicity, it has offered me a wealth of valuable insights into Flutter and Dart, helping me grasp the fundamentals of mobile development using these languages.

Through the development of this app, I acquired knowledge about the essential syntax of Dart and Flutter, and how to utilize widgets and handle their states effectively. Additionally, I learned how to import images for use in my mobile applications and implement basic theming, such as creating a gradient background.

#### Quiz App

In my next project, I took on the challenge of building a quiz application, and it proved to be an excellent learning experience. This interactive app allowed users to answer a series of questions and receive feedback on their performance when all questions are answered. 

During its development, I delved into advanced concepts like state management by "lifting states up", which enabled me to efficiently manage the application's state across multiple components. Moreover, I gained valuable insights into rendering content conditionally, dynamically displaying questions and options based on user interactions. Creating this quiz app not only honed my skills in Flutter and Dart but also strengthened my understanding of how to design engaging and interactive mobile applications.

#### Expense Tracker

This expense tracker application enables users to efficiently manage their expenses. It allows them to add and delete expenses while categorizing them into four distinct categories: food, leisure, travel, and work. Once the expenses are added, users can visualize their spending patterns with a responsive bar graph, providing valuable insights into their financial habits. Through creating this expense tracker app, I honed my skills in Flutter and Dart, developing a deeper understanding of creating engaging and user-friendly mobile applications.

The core skills I learnt while building this application were user input validation, where I made sure that data entered by users adhered to specific criteria and enhancing the app's reliability. Moreover, I explored the realm of in-depth theming by implementing both dark and light themes, offering users the freedom to customize their app's appearance to their preference. More importantly, I delved into the intricacies of building for responsiveness by adapting the user interface based on varying screen widths, such as landscape and portrait orientations.
